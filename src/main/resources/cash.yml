# ExpugnCash Information:
#  1) What is 'ExpugnCash'?
#    - ExpugnCash is an alternate form of currency. This is a marketing simulator so unlike
#        the static server currency, ExpugnCash fluxuates in price depending on how much
#        of the server currency the 'Expugn Stock Market' (ESM) has. This is a concept so everything may
#        not be perfect.
#  2) Cool. Give me some 'ExpugnCash' specifics!
#    - Only 50 ExpugnCash can be bought a day. Only 100 ExpugnCash can be sold a day. (per player.)
#    - The ESM will start with 1000 server currency.
#    - The default value will be 1 ExpugnCash = 1 ServerCurrency
#    - All purchases/sales will update as soon as possible.
